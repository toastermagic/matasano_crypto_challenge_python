# 2. Implement CBC mode
#
# CBC mode is a block cipher mode that allows us to encrypt irregularly-sized 
# messages, despite the fact that a block cipher natively only transforms individual 
# blocks.
# 
# In CBC mode, each ciphertext block is added to the next plaintext block before 
# the next call to the cipher core.
# 
# The first plaintext block, which has no associated previous ciphertext block, 
# is added to a "fake 0th ciphertext block" called the initialization vector, or IV.
# 
# Implement CBC mode by hand by taking the ECB function you wrote earlier, making 
# it encrypt instead of decrypt (verify this by decrypting whatever you encrypt 
# to test), and using your XOR function from the previous exercise to combine them.
# 
# The file here is intelligible (somewhat) when CBC decrypted against "YELLOW SUBMARINE" 
# with an IV of all ASCII 0 (\x00\x00\x00 &c)
