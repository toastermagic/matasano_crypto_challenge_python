# 6. Break repeating-key XOR
#
# The buffer at the following location:
#
#  https://gist.github.com/3132752
#
# is base64-encoded repeating-key XOR. Break it.
#
# Here's how:
#
# a. Let KEYSIZE be the guessed length of the key; try values from 2 to
# (say) 40.
#
# b. Write a function to compute the edit distance/Hamming distance
# between two strings. The Hamming distance is just the number of
# differing bits. The distance between:
#
#   this is a test
#
# and:
#
#   wokka wokka!!!
#
# is 37.
#
# c. For each KEYSIZE, take the FIRST KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and the
# SECOND KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and find the edit distance between
# them. Normalize this result by dividing by KEYSIZE.
#
# d. The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably
# the key. You could proceed perhaps with the smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE
# values. Or take 4 KEYSIZE blocks instead of 2 and average the
# distances.
#
# e. Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into
# blocks of KEYSIZE length.
#
# f. Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of
# every block, and a block that is the second byte of every block, and
# so on.
#
# g. Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already
# have code to do this.
#
# e. For each block, the single-byte XOR key that produces the best
# looking histogram is the repeating-key XOR key byte for that
# block. Put them together and you have the key.
